# Lab: Exploring Recursion
1. Factorial Calculation 
Write a recursive method factorial(int n) that returns n!

Test it for n = 5 and print the result.

2. Sum of Natural Numbers 
Write a recursive method sumN(int n) that returns the sum of the first n natural numbers.

Test it for n = 10 and print the result.

3. Multinomial Terms Count 
Write a recursive method multinomialTerms(int n, int k) based on the relation:
A(n, k) = A(n, k-1) + A(n-1, k)
with base cases A(n, 1) = 1 and A(0, k) = 1 for all valid k.

Compute and print multinomialTerms(4, 3).

4. String Reversal Using Recursion 
Write a recursive method reverseString(String s) that returns the input string reversed.

Test it with "recursion" and print the output.

Optional:
Add print statements inside these methods to trace recursive calls and better understand how recursion unfolds.
