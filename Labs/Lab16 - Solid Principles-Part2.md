# Task3 - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)  & Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

* Model different types of vehicles. Refactor so only appropriate vehicles can use certain features (e.g., only ElectricCar has charge(), GasCar has refeul()). Vehicle has make, model, year. Vehicles start() and charge() or refeul().

# Task4 -	Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) : Perimeter, Area, Volume

* You are designing a geometric shapes library. Not every shape supports all of perimeter, area and volume calculations (e.g., a line only has length, not area or perimeter, circle has perimeter, area, but not volume, ball has no perimeter, but has surface area and volume ).
Apply ISP so that no shape is forced to implement methods that do not make sense for it. 
  
# Task5 -	Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) : 

* Refactor a notification system so the sender class depends on a Notifier interface. Write two implementations: EmailNotifier and SMSNotifier.
