# Lab 2: Exploring ArrayList
________________________________________
## Objective: To understand dynamic arrays, their common operations, and the use of generics.
### Instructions:
#### 1.	ArrayList Creation and Population:
*	Create an ArrayList of String objects named fruits.
*	Add at least five different fruit names to the fruits ArrayList.
*	Create an ArrayList of Integer objects named studentAges.
*	Add at least five different ages to the studentAges ArrayList.
#### 2.	Accessing and Modifying Elements:
*	Print the element at index 2 in the fruits ArrayList.
* Change the fruit at index 0 to "Mango" and print the updated fruits ArrayList.
*	Retrieve and print the age of the student at index 3 from studentAges.
#### 3.	Adding and Removing Elements Dynamically:
*	Add "Grape" to the end of the fruits ArrayList.
* Add "Banana" at index 1 in the fruits ArrayList.
*	Remove the fruit at index 3 from the fruits ArrayList.
*	Remove the first occurrence of the Integer value 20 (if it exists) from studentAges.
#### 4.	Checking Size and Emptiness:
*	Print the current size of both fruits and studentAges.
*	Check if the fruits ArrayList is empty and print the result.
#### 5.	Iterating Through ArrayLists:
*	Use a standard for loop to print all elements of the fruits ArrayList.
*	Use an enhanced for loop to print all elements of the studentAges ArrayList.
#### 6.	Optional Challenge: Contains Check:
*	Check if the fruits ArrayList contains "Apple" and print a message indicating the result.
