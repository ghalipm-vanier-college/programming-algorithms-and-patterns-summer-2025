## Assignment #3: The Use of Data Structures (Stack, Queue, Binary Tree) and Recursion

### Stack 

1. **Push & Pop Integers**
   - Implement a stack of integers.
   - Push 5, 10, 20 onto the stack (in order).
   - Pop and print all elements until the stack is empty.
   - What is the output order? (Explain why.)

2. **Undo Functionality Simulation**
   - Simulate a simple undo feature:
   - Push a series of string actions onto a stack (e.g., "TypeA", "TypeB", "Delete", "InsertC").
   - “Undo” the last two actions by popping from the stack and printing each step.
   

### Queue 

3. **Enqueue & Dequeue**
   - Implement a queue of strings.
   - Enqueue "Alice", "Bob", "Carol".
   - Dequeue and print each name until the queue is empty.
   - What is the output order? (Explain FIFO principle.)

4. **Peek Front**
   - After enqueuing integers 7, 8, 9, use the peek operation to show the item at the front without removing it.
   - Confirm it remains after peeking by dequeueing and printing.

### Binary Tree 

5. **Insert & Inorder Traversal**
   - Implement a binary search tree.
   - Insert 15, 10, 20, 8, 12.
   - Print an inorder traversal. What does this order correspond to?

6. **Find Minimum and Maximum in BST**
    - Write two methods for your binary search tree:
    - findMin() to return the smallest value in the BST.
    - findMax() to return the largest value in the BST.
    - Insert 15, 10, 20, 8, 12, 17, 25 into your BST and print the results of both methods.

### Recursion 

7. **Recursive Sum of Array Elements**
   - Write a recursive method that takes an array of integers and returns the sum of all elements.
   - Test your method with the array {3, 5, 7, 9} and print the result.

**Instructions:**  
- For each part, show your class/implementation and a short main/demo for testing.
- Code should be minimal and focused on data structure logic.
- Briefly explain any output as prompted.
