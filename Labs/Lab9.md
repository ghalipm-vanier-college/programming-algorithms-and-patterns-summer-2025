The focus is on the basics, hands-on practice, and understanding tree traversal and manipulation using own 
custom `MyBinaryTree` class or similar.

## Lab: Problem Solving with Binary Trees

### 1.  Insert and Display (Inorder Traversal)
- Create a binary tree.
- Insert the values: 15, 10, 20, 8, 12, 17, 25 (in that order).
- Perform an inorder traversal and print the output.
- Explain what property of the binary tree is demonstrated by this traversal’s result.

### 2.  Search for a Value
- Write a method to check whether a value exists in the tree (e.g., search for 12 and 21).
- Print whether each value is found or not.

### 3. Compute Tree Height
- Write a method that returns the height (maximum depth) of the tree.
- Compute and print the tree’s height after all insertions from Exercise 1.

### 4.  Print All Leaf Nodes
- Write a method to print all the leaf nodes (nodes with no children) of the tree.
- Run this method for your tree and list the values.

The purpose of the exercises - to get comfortable with:
- Constructing a binary tree,
- Basic traversals (inorder),
- Searching,
- Recursion (implicitly in most tree operations),
- Understanding key tree properties.
