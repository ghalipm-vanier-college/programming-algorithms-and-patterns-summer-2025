Alternative Midterm Exam: Programming Algorithms & Patterns
Question 1: Encapsulation and Inheritance (10 points)
•	Define encapsulation in the context of object-oriented programming.
•	Suppose you have a base class Vehicle with a method move(). Describe how you could create a subclass Bicycle that also has a numberOfGears field and a move() method specific to bikes. What keywords and principles would you use, and why?
________________________________________
Question 2: Big-O Notation in Practice (10 points)
Consider the following code:
java
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
        sum += i * j;
    }
}
•	What is the overall time complexity (Big-O) in terms of n?
•	Briefly explain your reasoning.
________________________________________
Question 3: Recursion - List Sum (10 points)
•	Write a recursive function in pseudo-code or Java that calculates the sum of all numbers in an array of integers.
•	Clearly state the base case and the recursive step.
________________________________________
Question 4: MyLinkedList - Remove First Element (10 points)
•	When implementing a singly linked list, how would you code the removeFirst() method?
•	Describe all necessary pointer updates required, and mention how you would handle the case when the list is empty.
________________________________________
Question 5: Stack Implementation with Array (10 points)
•	Outline how you would implement a stack using a fixed-size array in Java.
•	Which variables must you keep track of to make push() and pop() work efficiently?
________________________________________
Question 6: Data Structures Choice (10 points)
•	You need to frequently insert elements at the beginning and end of a collection, but will rarely access elements by index.
•	Between ArrayList and LinkedList, which would you choose and why?
•	Support your answer with a brief note about the time complexity for common operations in each.
________________________________________
Question 7: Data Structure in Application - "Recent Files" Menu (10 points)
•	Consider a "Recent Files" feature that displays the last 10 files opened by a user in the order they were last accessed (most recent first).
•	What data structure(s) would you use to implement this feature most efficiently?
•	Explain your answer, referencing LIFO/FIFO principles and Big-O complexities for the main operations involved.
