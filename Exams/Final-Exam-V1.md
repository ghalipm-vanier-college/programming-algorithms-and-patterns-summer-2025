# Final Exam: Programming Algorithms & Patterns

***

### **Question 1 (5 points)**

* Define a lambda expression in Java.  
* Write an example lambda that takes two integers and returns their sum.  

***

### **Question 2 (5 points)**

* Explain what a stream is in Java and provide an example of filtering and collecting even numbers from an `ArrayList<Integer>` using streams.

***

### **Question 3 (10 points)**

* Describe the Iterator design pattern.  
* Why is it beneficial to use an iterator instead of directly accessing elements of a collection in Java?  
* Write a code snippet demonstrating how to use an iterator to print all values in a `List<String>`.

***

### **Question 4: SOLID Principles â€“ Single Responsibility (10 points)**

* State the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and give a practical example in your own words (no code needed).

***

### **Question 5: Implementing a Queue Using Linked List (10 points)**
* Describe how you would implement a queue using  linked list. Which node pointers would you maintain, and how would you handle enqueue and dequeue operations?
* Write a brief Java or pseudocode snippet illustrating the key steps for enqueue and dequeue methods.

***

### **Question 6: Open/Closed Principle (OCP) & Dependency Inversion (DIP) (10 points)**

* Explain how OCP and DIP help make code more extensible and testable.  
* Describe a situation in which using an interface for dependency invertion improves code flexibility.

***

### **Question 7 (10 points)**

* Explain the core idea behind the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.  
* In Spring MVC, what roles do the Controller and the View components play?

***

### **Question 8 (10 points)**

* Given the following list:
    ```java
    List<String> words = Arrays.asList("cat", "dog", "car", "apple");
    ```
* Write a single stream operation (including a lambda expression) that prints all words starting with 'c'.

***


### **Question 9 (10 points)**

* Given the following list:
    ```java
    List<String> words = Arrays.asList("ant", "bat", "cat", "dog", "fish", "lama", "rabbit");
    ```
* Write a single stream operation that converts each string to uppercase, filters for words longer than 3 letters, and collects the result into a new list.

### **Question 10 (5 points)**

* How can you use a lambda expression to sort a list of `Student` objects by their GPA in descending order using `Collections.sort()`?

***

### **Question 11: Iterator Pattern (5 points)**
* Describe the Iterator design pattern. Why is it beneficial to use an iterator instead of directly accessing elements of a collection in Java?
* Write a code snippet demonstrating how to use an iterator to print all values in a Set<String>.

***


### **Question 12 (10 points)**

* Given a requirement to notify users by email or SMS, outline (in a paragraph or short diagram) 
how you would use the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) to design a flexible notification system.
